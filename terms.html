        <p><span class="notedRemoteHili">The following terms and conditions shall govern the placement and delivery of advertising as set forth in any insertion orders or service agreements (“<strong>IO</strong>”) executed by and between Taptica International Ltd (“<strong>Taptica</strong>“) and Publisher.</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><u>Services</u></strong><strong>.</strong> Taptica will enable the provision of commercial advertisement
                ads on Publisher’s Site(s) (as defined below) through the use of the Taptica platform, as well as manage and
                deliver all such advertisements in the form requested by Publisher and in accordance with any specifications
                and policies set-forth by Publisher prior to publication (the “<strong>Services</strong>”). Publisher may implement
                the Services only on such approved Publisher properties as set forth in a given IO (the “<strong>Site(s)</strong>“).
                Any change or amendment to the list of Site(s) must be done in writing and approved in advance by Taptica.</li>
            <li><strong><u>Consideration</u></strong><strong>.</strong> (i) In return for the Services, Taptica shall retain a percentage
                of the Net Revenues (as defined below) derived from the Services, as set forth in the IO. <strong>“</strong><strong>Net Revenue”</strong>            means the revenue actually received from advertisers in relation to Qualified Transactions as part of the Services,
                less any taxes that Taptica is required to pay or collect in relation to the supply of Services, any credit card
                processing fees, bad debt and charge-backs, commissions or discounts allowed or paid to advertising agencies,
                refunds to advertisers and third party partners and other payments to third parties if applicable. A “<strong>Qualified Transaction</strong>”
                means a transaction that occurs when a bona fide Internet user views or fulfills some kind of actions (as agreed
                between the parties) in relation to the ad that appears in one of the Sites; it is hereby clarified that transaction
                due to injection traffic, bot traffic or automatic injections by toolbars shall not be considered Qualified Transactions.
                (ii) Taptica will pay Publisher in accordance with the revenue statement forty-five (45) business days following
                the end of the calendar month for which payment is due. Publisher acknowledges and agrees that Taptica may, at
                its sole discretion, discount, credit back or accrue a credit against revenue shares already provided to the
                Publisher for transactions which were deemed to be non-Qualified Transactions following payment. (iii) All payments
                due are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including without limitation
                VAT) (collectively, “<strong>Taxes</strong>”). Publisher will be responsible for payment of all Taxes and any
                related interest and penalties resulting from any payments made hereunder. To the extent that Inventory is determined
                by Taptica to be a result of non-Qualified Transactions, then, in addition to any other remedy available to Taptica,
                Publisher agrees that Invalid Impressions shall not be payable by Taptica. Any and all payments previously made
                by Taptica to Publisher on account of Publisher Sites which are subsequently deemed to include non-Qualified
                Transactions shall be promptly refunded to Taptica. Taptica shall have the right to off-set any amounts owed
                to it pursuant to this paragraph against any amounts owing to Publisher under this Agreement.</li>
            <li><strong><u>Reporting</u></strong>. Calculation of all payments made hereunder to Publisher will be made based solely
                on Taptica’s reporting system and statistics. Taptica will provide Publisher with access to its reporting interface
                that will enable Publisher to view an estimate of any amounts owed to it under this IO.</li>

                provided by Publisher to Taptica is correct and current; and (b) Publisher is the owner of each Site or that

                or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provisions in any other jurisdiction. Neither party will
                be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement if the delay or
                failure is due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party. This Agreement, including

                the Services and related Confidential Information.&nbsp; It supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals,
                agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter.&nbsp;
                This Agreement may only be amended by a written document executed by both parties.</li>
